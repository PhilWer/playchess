"""Segment empty chessboard from image, and get centers of each cell.
This script is based on OpenCV and numpy (no ROS-related dependencies), and implements a class that segments a chessboard from an image (based on contours), and identifies the center of each cell in the chessboard (based on Hough transform). As a unique set of Hough transform parameters is hard to be identified experimentally, two tuning methods are implemented:
- manual, based on sliders in a graphical interface
- automatic, based on Bayesian Optimization
